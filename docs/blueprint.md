# **App Name**: Pill Pal

## Core Features:

- Medication Input: Users can input their medications including name, dosage, frequency, and timing, either manually or via QR code scanning.
- Medication Schedule: Display a clear, easy-to-understand medication schedule with visual reminders and alerts.
- Adherence Logging: Allow users to log when they have taken their medication and track adherence over time.

- Gamification: Implement a points and rewards system based on medication adherence, motivating users to stay consistent.
- Reminders: Send push notifications at scheduled times to remind users to take their medication.
- Personalized Health Prompts: The application uses an LLM to determine the relevance of various bits of outside health or safety advice to the specific medications that the user is taking.
